# About This Project
Because Original Project are Weirdly Large, So I reopen a GitHub repository to lowering it down.

This project is making AI more overpowered and user friendly.

I will try to make this "overpowered" AI support to official version of [CCNHsK-Dev/SyPB](https://github.com/CCNHsK-Dev/SyPB)


Thanks to [CCNHsK-Dev](http://ccnhsk-dev.blogspot.hk/) making this awesome CS1.6 AI Improvement.

## Noteable Changes With Original SyPB
 - No more supporting XP version
 - No more ugly code (some of them are hard to read and understanding)
 - Adding More Translation about These Functions
 - Lower Usage
 - Performance Upgrade
